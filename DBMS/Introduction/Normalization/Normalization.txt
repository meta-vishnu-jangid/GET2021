Normalization =>  Normalization  is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations.
Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion and updation anomalies.

Normal Forms =>

1.) 1NF =>
          A relation is said to be 1NF if it has only Single Value for a tuple.
	  example:-

          Stud_name        Stud_subject

             A		Physics , chemistry

          It should be like
	  
	  Stud_name   Stud_subject

             A		Physics 
 	     A 		Chemistry


2.) 2NF  =>
	  A relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and don't have partial dependency. No non prime attribute directly depend on any proper
	  Subset of Candidate Key.
	
	  Example:-

	    Stud_name        course_id        course_name
             A		        1		PCM

	  here candidate key is (stud_name,couse_id). here course_name is dependent on course_id which is proper subset of Candidate Key.
	  So For 2NF we have to remove partial dependency.

	  Solution => 
		 Stud_name        course_id       
            	    A		        1	
     
   		 course_id        course_name
                    1		      PCM


3.) 3NF  =>
	  A relation is said to be in 3NF if it isn 2NF and there is no transitive dependency.like 1 non prime attribute is dependent on other non
	  prime attribute that is dependent on prime attribute.

	  Example:-
		
	    person_name    zipcode     city
  		A 	     121  	AA

	  Here City is dependent on zipcode which is dependent on person_name wher person_name is candidate key.

	  Solution =>
	
		    person_name    zipcode     
  			A 	     121  	
		
		    zipcode     city
  		      121  	 AA


4.) BCNF  =>
	   A relation is said to be in BCNF if in all functional dependency LHS is super key.in x->y x is super key
	
	   Example:=>
			
		 person_id    person_name      course_id    course_name
  		   1	         ABC   		121  	     AA

 	   candidate key(person_id, course_id)
           here course_name is dependent on course id which is not a super key 
    
           Solution =>

	 	person_id    person_name     
  		   1	         ABC 
  		
		course_id    course_name
  		  121  	         AA
